# stock-info
This application allows you to search certain stocks and it will display some basic information about the stock.
Including: PE Ratio, Div Yield, Current price, Companies name, Stock name and more.

Hopes for this application:
Eventually we would like to see a graphing function as well as trends to a certain stock.
Also we would eventually like to create real-time feeds.
We also would like to add a trending page, which is the biggest increase of the day, biggest fall, etc.

How does it work?
The application downloads the .csv file from Yahoo and reads the information off of it and displays it to the user.
Users can check one stock at a time (at the moment).

How to search within the application?
You simply just type the stock name in the dialog box.
an example of this would be: FB for Facebook, Goog for Alphabet Inc., AAPL for Apple Inc., etc.
